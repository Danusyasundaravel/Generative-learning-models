# Topic-modelling


This repository contains code and data for performing topic modeling on a budget speech document using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract key topics from a budget speech. This can help in understanding the main themes discussed and in summarizing the speech content over four
years.

## Dataset used

Data collected from https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/bspeech.php where past four years (2020-2024) has been used to perform topic modeling.
